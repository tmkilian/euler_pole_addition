# euler_pole_addition
Can be used to add two Euler poles to produce one single Euler pole.

This repository contains an extremely simple approach to combining Euler rotation poles. Latitude, longitude, and rotation angle must be input manually - could be modified into an euler class or at least a function that allows batch addition of Euler Poles. Be careful which pole is input first as the the order of addition matters!
